                <p>When I was a kid, my parents brought home a Commodore 64, the first computer my family ever owned.
                    Figuring out how to do anything with the C64 took us a long time, because nothing about that beige
                    machine was intuitive. &nbsp;We'd plod through manuals and type out the commands, eventually
                    managing to
                    load the simple programs and video games that friends had copied onto floppy disks. &nbsp;As we grew
                    more comfortable, we tried to write out simple, text-base adventure games, full of dragons and magic
                    swords. &nbsp;Yes, making games and figuring out how to get our computer to spit out the results
                    that we
                    wanted was strangely fun.</p>
                <p>Today's computers hide most of the coding behind wonderfully designed user interfaces. &nbsp;I'm not
                    nostalgic for the C64, but I do miss the sense of discovery that I used to have. &nbsp;I want to
                    understand a lot more about how computers and programs work. &nbsp;With that in mind, I decided to
                    start
                    this blog.</p>
                <p>In this blog, I want to share my experience of learning how to program. &nbsp;Along with my coding
                    mishaps and (hopefully) achievements, I hope to post anything that I find about creating code,
                    interesting websites, and the coding communities that I visit.</p>
                <p>
                    So, let's see if I remember how to do this...</p>

                <h2>Where to Start?</h2>
                <p>Luckily for anyone trying to learn about computers and programming, there are so many free resources
                    available online. Gone are the days of flipping through dry, technical manuals.</p>
                <p>I'm going to spend the first few weeks of my exploration working through the exercises offered in
                    these popular computer programming web sites:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">http://www.codecademy.com/</a></li>
                    <br />
                    <li><a href="http://www.codeavengers.com/">http://www.codeavengers.com/</a></li>
                    <br />
                    <li><a href="http://www.khanacademy.org/computing/cs">http://www.khanacademy.org/computing/cs</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    At this early stage, I'm still trying to figure out what languages are the most
                    useful/accessible/widely
                    used. &nbsp;But, I do know that the web is built on HTML and JavaScript, so these seem like good
                    places
                    to start.
                </p>

                    I'll check them out.
